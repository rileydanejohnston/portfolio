I thought the course would teach me about servers. The topic of the class was programming with C instead. I\'ve completed a ten-month web development boot camp, gone back to college for computer science, deployed two full-stack projects, and created a portfolio in the two years since then.',

  farmApp: 'I also like programming with C++. I recently built a farm application, which allowed users to create a farm and calculate financial figures. The app used many object-oriented principles like polymorphism, inheritance, and composition. It could also add animals and crops to the farm dynamically using pointers and vectors.',
