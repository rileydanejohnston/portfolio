  beginning: 'I discovered programming by accident. I worked as a customer service agent at a software company when I took an online CS class to sound more knowledgeable when talking to customers. I thought the course would teach me about servers. The topic of the class was programming with C instead. I\'ve completed a ten-month web development boot camp, gone back to college for computer science, deployed two full-stack projects, and created a portfolio in the two years since then. It\'s safe to say I got hooked.',
  goals: 'I became a software engineer to turn exciting ideas into a reality. I\'m interested in solving problems, helping people, protecting the environment, and contributing to the world.',
  webDev: 'I\'m fascinated by the idea that anyone on earth can use web applications as long as they have an internet connection. One of my long-term goals is to create and manage an app that people can use for free. Some applications that are inspired me to pursue web development are Google Docs, Trello, and Sketchboard.',
  education: 'I completed a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of South Carolina in 2013.

I recently got accepted to Oregon State University, and I plan to continue my education in the Fall of 2022.',
